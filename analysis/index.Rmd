StealTHY eludes CRISPR immunogenicity to expose concealed metastatic regulators (2025)


## Abstract

CRISPR screens have become standard gene discovery platforms in various contexts, including cancer. Yet, commonly available CRISPR-Cas9 tools are increasingly recognized as unfit for in vivo investigations in immunocompetent contexts, due to broad immunogenicity of bacterial nucleases and reporters. Here, we show how conventional CRISPR screens in tumor grafts are systematically jeopardized by immunoediting in syngeneic and humanized immunocompetent hosts, resulting in iatrogenic clonal dropouts and ultimately compromising target identification. To resolve this, we present StealTHY, an immunogen-free CRISPR platform compatible with virtually all immunocompetent designs, enabling preservation of clonal architecture and exposing previously concealed cancer vulnerabilities. Among these, we identify the AMH-AMHR2 axis as a formerly unappreciated metastasis target. Thus, with StealTHY, we provide a new resource to expand the applicability of CRISPR screens to immunocompetent models including humanized tumor grafts, revealing metastasis regulators of therapeutic relevance. 

## Data pre-processing

Raw data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI), under the accession codes [GSE268044](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE268044), [GSE268045](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE268045) and [GSE268588](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE268588). Data processing is computationally expensive and is not covered in this repository. We provide description of the data pre-processing workflow together with software version in the original publication. Processed data, large result files, additional functions, references and metadata are were archived at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11208099.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11208099)

##  Data and code availability

To reproduce our analysis, first clone source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/saini-stealTHY). This repository is also archived at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11288553.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/11288553)

    git clone https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/saini-stealTHY

Next, download processed data and output data deposited in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11374563) into the cloned project folder and untar the files.

## Reproducibility

The results form our analyses are listed below in webpage format. They were generated from R Markdown documents deposited in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/saini-stealTHY). The workflow of the analysis was created using the [workflowr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/workflowr/index.html) R package and can be reproduced in its totality using [workflowr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/workflowr/index.html) [wflow_build](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowrBeta/reference/wflow_build.html) command after the installation of the proper R packages. Session info, including R and package versions, was automatically included at the end of each analysis file.

Files containing pre-computed results from differential expression or gene-set enrichment analyses were deposited in [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11374563.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11374563). In order to generate those files again change the option `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` in the specific code chunk from the R Markdown file.
